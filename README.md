## Purpose

To better understand how servers function by integrating existing HTML and Javascript elements.

## Installation

This application uses Express version 4.19.2 and UUID version 9.0.1. A user would install these by typing "npm install express@4.19.2" and "npm install uuid@9.0.1" within their terminal.

## Usage

Referring to the media of the site [here](#media-of-application), a user simply has to input a note title and subsequently click the "save note" button. The "note text" is optional. A user can cancel a note in progress by clicking the "clear form" button. A user can also delete a note by clicking the red trash bin item on any of the notes saved on the left side of the page. A user can select any of the notes on the left side of the page to bring it to focus on the center of the screen in the note input area.

## Credits

* Express version 4.19.2
